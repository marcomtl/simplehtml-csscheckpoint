                Hello, this website is going to be about my favorite childhood and adult tv shows. I’ve decided to split up my material into two sections. These sections are tv series’ and tv sitcoms. I like to think of a tv series as a show that follows a pattern with longer run-time and that has more of a movie element to it. On the other hand, I think of sitcoms, or situational comedies, as shows with a comical theme that has shorter run-times and less emphasis on storyline.

                On the next few pages, I’ve organized a few of my favorite tv series’ and tv sitcoms. Lastly, I created a contact page where you can reach me and share your own television favorites. I felt like this page would be beneficial because I am always on the hunt for new binge-worthy tv-shows. Below I’ve provided a list of the shows that I recommend:
