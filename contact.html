                I want to thank you for visiting my site and taking the time to go through my favorite tv shows with me. I hope you were able to find a few suggestions that are new and interesting to you. Whether youâ€™re interested in hour-long series that show gore and action, or interested in family family comedy shows. Whether you enjoy watching American or international shows. I believe I incorporate a wide variety of shows that could suit your needs.             </p>

                Furthermore, just as I provided you all with great suggestions, I would love to receive some as well. This page allows you to send me an email at my personal email address. This way, I would hope that I can receive some great suggestions of television shows that are not on these lists. Sending two or three of your favorite shows would be greatly appreciated. Afterall, I can never have too many shows to watch because it seems like I finish one every other week. Thank you again for your time.
